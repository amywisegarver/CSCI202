<h5>BACKGROUND:</h5>

Amy Wisegarver was born in Hillsboro, Oregon (August 14th, 1998), and raised in Sammamish, WA. She went to high school at Eastlake High School in Sammamish, and moved to Bellingham, WA in 2017 to attend Western Washington University to pursue an undergrad degree in graphic design. Amy began dancing at 3 years old, and competed from age 7 to 17, and has dabbled in many other art forms. She also plays the violin and sings, and played in a few bands in high school. Amy hopes to graduate from Western Washington University with a BFA in graphic design, and work for a design firm as UX designer after graduation. She loves Washington, and would love to work in Seattle and eventually make it back to Bellingham one day.
